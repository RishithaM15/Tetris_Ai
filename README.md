The goal of the project is to make a model that predicts the best rotation and drop spot for the piece in a tetris game in order to maximize the number of peices dropped before dying. The performence measure will be the number of moves made before dying but lines cleared will also be taken into account. Since the game isn't keeping track of any sort of score other than lines cleared and moves made, nothing else will have to be considered, unlike some verisonss of tetris. Additionally, the peices given are compeltely random.
